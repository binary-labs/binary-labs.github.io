              <a href="https://www.moritzsimongeist.com/works/vibrations">Vibrations</a> is a distributed robotic vibraphone by Moritz Simon Geist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The installation consists of up to 36 tone plates connected to a central unit.
              Each tone plate is equipped with a mallet driven by a solenoid.
              A damper actuated by a stepper motor allows for sustained and non-sustained play modes.
              A piezo pickup senses the vibrations of the tone plate.
              Each plate is completed with electronics, digitizing the output signal of the piezo and controlling the mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Communication the tone plates and the central units are connected in chains of up to 12 tone plates (heads) via regular ethernet cables.
              The four twisted pairs are used to exchange control data between the heads and the central unit, stream audio from the heads to the central unit as well as provide logic level power to the heads.
              The actuators on each tone plate are powered through a separate chaining system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The central unit takes midi data for playing and configuring the instrument and provides analog audio outputs with mixed down signals from all connected heads.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were responsible for hardware and firmware development.
              The central challenge of this project was the design of the high speed bus for streaming audio data between the heads and the central unit.
              We solved this with impedance controlled PCB design and by implementing a serial protocol synchronized by the central unit.
              The synchronization was also used to drive the resampling necessary due to the separated audio clock domains of heads and central unit.

              Roseguarden is an open source access management system for shared spaces.
              It is developed at <a href="https://konglomerat.org/">Konglomerat e.V.</a>
              and currently in use to provide access to users of the fablab in <a href="https://konglomerat.org/rosenwerk.html">#Rosenwerk</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The system consists of a <a href="https://github.com/konglomerat/roseguarden">self-hosted backend server</a> and multiple door nodes connected to it via internet or local area network.
              Each door node physically controls the access to one door and allows users to identify themselves via RFID tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our role in the project was to develop the <a href="https://github.com/konglomerat/roseguarden.hardware">firmware for a proof-of-concept door node</a> on an ESP32 based platform.

            <p>
              Midilooper is a performative loop station that operates on MIDI messages.
              In contrast to looping in the audio domain where a lot of musical information has already been merged,
              this approach provides musicians with more flexibility to morph their loops.
              This way midilooper is crossing the gap between looping and sequencing.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this device, we developed two special input circuits.
              One is a control voltage input that can be reconfigured through software into an interface for a passive pedal switch.
              The other one is a standard compliant MIDI TRS input that can also be used as a modular level clock input.
            </p>
            <p>
              The firmware was developed completely by us.
              Its core feature is a storage structure for MIDI information that allows fast read and write access,
              arbitrary track lengths and flexible distribution of storage capacity between tracks.
              Additionally, it can be serialized to non-volatile memory allowing for fast and seamless switching between banks.

            <p>Thyme is an experimental delay-based effects processor.</p>
            <p>As the instrument focuses on the exploration of the space inbetween classical delay based audio effects, we had to develop a signal processing chain that is both flexible to control and efficient in terms of processing power.</p>
            <p>Next to firmware development, we supported hardware development and created a semi-automatic testing rig for production.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to adapt <b>state-of-the-art techniques from software engineering</b> to the world of embedded software
        to produce quick and reliable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use <b>rapid prototyping technologies</b> to allow testing of devices in their future environment at an early stage of development.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rely almost entirely on <b>open-source</b> software tools and deliver our work in open file formats
        that do not force you to use expensive tools or lock you to a specific operating system.
